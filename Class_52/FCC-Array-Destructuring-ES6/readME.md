## Summary:
The concepts covered in this reading:

* Destructuring - Extracting multiple properties from an array through assignments
    * Declaration & assignment can be done seperately.
    * Returned arrays can be destructured.
    * Can be used to swap the values of two variables.
    * Nested arrays may be destructured.
* The (...) operator - Added in ES6 & can be used in destructuring.
    * Rest parameter - Used to map all the remaining elements in the array that have not been mapped to the rest variable itself. 
    * Spread syntax - It takes all the other elements in the array which have no variable mapped to them and then maps it to the rest variable.

## Lessons learned:
I don't recall having used or seen destructuring up until now. 
I will be able to extract data from an array more efficiently with this technique.

Prior to this reading I knew very little about spread syntax-- I have seen it being used in examples.

It surprised me when I found out about the rest parameter. It looks exactly like spread syntax, but is the opposite of spread syntax.

From the MDN:
Spread syntax "expands" an array into its elements, while rest syntax collects multiple elements and "condenses" them into a single element.
