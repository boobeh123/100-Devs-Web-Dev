## Summary:
The concepts covered in this video:

* Filter() - Creates a shallow copy of a portion of a given array, filtered down to just the elements from the given array that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
* Map() - Creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
* Find() - Returns the first element in the provided array that satisfies the provided testing function. If no values satisfy the testing function, undefined is returned.
* forEach() - Executes a provided function once for each array element.
* Some() - Tests whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function. It returns true if, in the array, it finds an element for which the provided function returns true; otherwise it returns false. It doesn't modify the array.
* Every() - Tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a Boolean value.
* Reduce() - Executes a user-supplied "reducer" callback function on each element of the array, in order, passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding element. The final result of running the reducer across all elements of the array is a single value.
* Includes() - Determines whether an array includes a certain value among its entries, returning true or false as appropriate.

## Lessons learned:
This video covers methods that a web dev will commonly see and use. 

I have used all of these methods before in projects & coding challenges. All of the content in the video is mostly review for me at the time of watching this video.
