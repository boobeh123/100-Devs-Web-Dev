## Summary:
The concepts covered in this reading:

* Adding/Removing from an array:
    * Push() – Adds items to the end of an array.
    * Pop() – Extracts an item from the end of an array.
    * Shift() – Extracts an item from the beginning of an array.
    * Unshift() – Adds items to the beginning of an array.
* Delete keyword - Removes a value by the key. Not ideal for arrays.
* Splice() - Can insert, remove, and replace elements from an array.
* Slice() - Returns a new array that copies all items from index start to end.
* Concat() - Creates a new array that includes values from other arrays and additional items.
* forEach() - Allows to run a function for every element of the array.
* Searching an array:
    * indexOf() - Looks for item starting from index from, and returns the index where it was found, otherwise -1.
    * lastIndexOf() - The same as indexOf, but looks for from right to left.
    * Includes() - Looks for item starting from index from, returns true if found.
    * Find() - If find returns true, the search is stopped, the item is returned. If nothing found, undefined is returned.
    * findIndex() - Returns the index where the element was found 
    * findLastIndex() - like findIndex, but searches from right to left.
* Filter() - Returns an array of all matching elements.
* Map() - Calls the provided function for each element of the array and returns the array of results.
* Sort() - Rearranges the array in place, changing an arrays element order.
* Reverse() - Reverses the order of elements in an array and returns the reversed array.
* Split() - Splits the string into an array.
* Join() - Creates a string of array items.
* Reduce() - Used to calculate a single value based on the array.
* reduceRight() - Does the same as reduce(), but goes from right to left.
* Array.isArray() - Returns true if the value is an array, false otherwise.
* thisArg - Almost all array methods that call functions accept an optional additional parameter thisArg.
* Some()/Every() - Checks the array. Called on each element of the array. If any/all results are true, returns true, otherwise false.
* Fill() - Fills the array with repeating value from index start to end.
* copyWithin() - Copies its elements from position start till position end into itself, at position target (overwrites existing).
* Flat()/FlatMap() - Create a new flat array from a multidimensional array.

## Lessons learned:
This is the second pass-through this specific chapter fromm JavaScript.info. 

The reading provides a few real-life scenarios where some methods are used and surprisingly I have used it in that way too.

The tasks were tough. I looked back at my notes/tasks from my first pass-through and I can tell I looked at the answer for every single task back then.

This time around, I was able to solve most of the tasks through PREPing through the question. I thought it would be easier after all this time/study! It was NOT!!  

If you're interested in what my work looked like on my first pass-through: https://codepen.io/boobeh123/pen/MWrQrYK

(I didn't know how to use GitHub back when this was first assigned.)
