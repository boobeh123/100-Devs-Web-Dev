## Summary:
The concepts covered in this video:

* Fundamentals of Object-Oriented-Programming
    * Creating objects using literal notation.
    * Returning multiple objects using a factory function.
    * Creating multiple objects using a constructor function.
    * The constructor property:
        * References the function that was used to create the object.
    * Functions are objected and have access to methods & properties.
    * Value Types:
        * Primitives are copied by their value.
    * Reference Types:
        * Objects are copied by their reference.
    * Adding properties:
        * Dot notation
        * Bracket notation
    * Removing properties:
        * Delete operator
    * Iterating properties:
        * For in loop:
            * Iterating over properties
            * Iterating over property values
            * Iterating over properties only        (no methods)
            * Iterating over property values only   (no methods)
        * Object.keys - Returns properties in an array
        * in operator - Check an object for a given property or method
    * Converting properties & methods to private using local variables.
    * Metods to return a private property 
        * Define a method that returns the private property
        * defineProperty method to define Getter and Setters
* 4 Pillars of Object-Oriented-Programming:
    * Encapsulation
    * Abstraction
    * Inheritance
    * Polymorphism

## Learn anything new?
Yes. Do you know what shocks me the most? This is NOT my first time through this lesson.

I know the differences in the syntax when creating an object literally, with a factory, with a constructor, or with a class. 

I can use the constructor property on objects to see the function used to create the object. 

I don't have a clear idea when or why I would iterate over an object. 

I 'get' that properties can be modified by the consumer of the object.
I can prevent that modification from happening by converting a property to a private property / local variable.

Getter and Setters are still foreign to me, but I know that it helps with reading private properties.

This is my second time completing the stopwatch exercise. A lot of my properties and methods remained the same. 
The main difference in the build is the object uses a class and constructor vs an object literal. 

## Optimizations:
Referring specifically to the stopwatch;
* I can add a visual appearance to this object. 
    * A button to click start
    * A button to click end
    * Display the duration property on a 'screen'
    * A button to reset the display and timestamps
