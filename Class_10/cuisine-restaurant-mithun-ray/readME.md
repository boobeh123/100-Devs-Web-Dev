## Description
Itadaki is my take on Mithun Ray's Cuisine Restaurant layout. 
I wanted to build this project as a way to demonstrate my design, development, and add a webpage to my portfolio.

The current site is deployed on netlify at: https://btacuisine-restaurant.netlify.app/

## Optimizations 
* Improve performance category on Google Lighthouse scoring.
* Improve screen reader experience.

## Lessons learned
I went into this project with my main focus being on the design, development, and adding my own taste to the layout. 

By the end of the project I dipped my toes into web accessibility, performant webpages and SEO. 
I have a better understanding of using `aria` attributes. 
I learned how to convert png/jpg into webp format u sing the `cwebp-cli` command && that `img` elements must have height & width properties defined explicitly.
I learned how to improve initial page load performance--text on the page can be rendered before fonts are loaded && that hero images can be preloaded.
