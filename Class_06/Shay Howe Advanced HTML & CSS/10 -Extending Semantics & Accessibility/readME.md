## Lessons learned:
Still reading...TBD

The concepts covered in this chapter deeply cover semantics. 
I learned that screen readers recognize elements with the hidden attribute. 

There are multiple elements mentioned in this chapter. Each were compared against others and given examples. These examples displays where, how, and why specific elements should be used over others.

I am eager to see where the meter & progress elements can be used! 

I haven't dived into Microdata or WAI-ARIA yet and I know these could change everything.
