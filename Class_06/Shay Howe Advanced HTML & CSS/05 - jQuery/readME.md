## What did you learn?
jQuery is a JavaScript library focusing on DOM Manipulation, AJAX calls, and Event handling.
I haven't built projects using jQuery besides the examples in this reading.
jQuery is similar to what I've already learned and the syntax is readable to me. 

jQuery selectors can select elements and style elements.
jQuery traversing provides many methods that allows for filtering or selecting elements, adding, removing, or changing styles.
jQuery also provides a handful of methods that may manipulate elements by altering the DOM, styles, or attributes.
jQuery easily adds one or multiple event handlers to elements. 



"The top 10,000 websites JavaScript is used within over 92% of them, 
and jQuery is used within in over 63% of them." 

I was hesitant to read this chapter-- 
I know JavaScript, why do I need to know jQuery? 
It wasn't until I read the line above this sentence. 

If over 60% of the TOP ten-thousand websites use jQuery, what is the percentage after scaling up? I figured it wouldn't hurt me to at least read about jQuery as a "first-pass-through."
