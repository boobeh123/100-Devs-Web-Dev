## Summary:
The concepts covered in this chapter:

* Abstraction: Allows us to write complicated code in a way thatâ€™s easy to reuse, debug, and understand for human readers.
* Functions As Data: We can work with functions the same way we work with any other type of data, including reassigning them to new variables.
    * JavaScript functions are first-class objects, so they have properties and methods like any other object.
Higher-order functions: A function that either accepts functions as parameters, returns a function, or both.
Callback functions: A function that is passed in as an argument.

## Learn anything new?
I now understand what qualifies a function to be a callback function or a higher-order function.
