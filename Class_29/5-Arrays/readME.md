## Summary:
The concepts covered in this chapter:

* Arrays: Arrays are lists that store data in JavaScript. Arrays can be created using square brackets [literal notation].
* Array Index: Each element inside of an array is at a numbered position, or index, starting at 0.
* Accessing Arrays: We can access an element in an array using its index, with syntax like: myArray[0].
* Updating Array Values: We can also change an element in an array using its index, with syntax like myArray[0] = 'new string';
* .length Property: Arrays have a length property, which allows you to see how many items are in an array.
* Array Methods: 
    * Arrays have their own methods, including .push() and .pop(), which add and remove items from an array, respectively. 
    * Arrays have many methods that perform different tasks, such as .slice() and .shift().
* Array mutation:
    * .push() and .pop() methods mutate the original array.
    * Arrays declared with let or const are still mutable.
        * This applies to the array elements and not the value of the variable.
    * Arrays mutated inside of a function will keep that change even outside the function.
* Nested Arrays: Arrays can store other arrays.
    * Accessing Nested Arrays: Chain indices using bracket notation.

I have a better understanding of array mutability.
