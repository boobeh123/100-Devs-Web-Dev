## Summary:
The concepts covered in this chapter:

* Loops: Perform repetitive actions so we don’t have to code that process manually every time.
* For Loops: 
    * Using a for loop that increments or decrements.
    * Using for loop to iterate through an array.
    * Understanding stopping conditions to prevent infinite loops.
* Nested for loops: A loop inside another loop.
    * The outer loop iterates once and the inner loop iterates entirely.
* While loops: Allow for different types of stopping conditions.
* Do...While loops: Run code at least once— only checking the stopping condition after the first execution.
* The break keyword: Allow programs to leave a loop during the execution of its block.

## Learn anything new?
I understand how to use break in an active loop and that do...while loops can run the code once before looping.
