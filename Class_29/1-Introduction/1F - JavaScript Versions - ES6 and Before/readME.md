## Summary
* JavaScript was introduced in 1995.
    * Created by Netscape Communications.
        * Created for web designers & programmars to interact with web pages.
* The next year, Netscape Communications submitted JavaScript to Ecma International.
    * Submitted to create standards for a scripting language.
* Ecma International releases ECMA-262 In 1997.
    * ECMA-262 sets standards for the first scripting language called ECMAScript.
    * ECMAScript standards provided rules for the architecture of JavaScript features.
* Distinguish differences between JavaScript & ECMAScript:
    * If you want to create an app or program you can use JavaScript.
    * If you want to create a new scripting language, follow the guidelines in ECMAScript.
    * JavaScript ES6: Version of JavaScript following the specifications in the sixth edition of ECMAScript. (AKA ES2015)
* "Modern JavaScript"
    * ES6 is the biggest update made to ECMAScript since the first edition in 1997.
        * Up-to-date browsers support most of the ES6 features.
        * Features added in ES6:
            * New keywords to declare variables (let & const).
            * New function syntax (Arrow functions).
            * Creation of Classes.
            * Parameters with default values.
            * Promises for asynchronous actions.
    * There is strong adoption of ES6 in the development community.
        * Benefits of ES6 syntax made it easier to utilize Objected Oriented Programming.
            * This allowed developers of other languages to transition into learning and using JavaScript.
        * Another reason for the popularity of ES6 is correlated with the usage of ES6 in popular frameworks like React.
* Legacy code
    * Many projects are built and maintained with pre-ES6 code.
    * Familiarizing yourself with pre-ES6 and ES6 JavaScript syntax can give you the ability and freedom to work on any JavaScript project.
