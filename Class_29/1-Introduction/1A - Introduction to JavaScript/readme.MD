### Learn anything new?
Most of the topics covered in this reading are common across other platforms.
There are two methods that I haven't used at all. It's surprising to discover methods I haven't used, especially this early into the reading.

The two:

string.startsWith('A') - This method determines whether a string begins with the characters of a specified string, returning true or false as appropriate.

Number.isInteger(2) - This method determines whether the passed value is an integer.
