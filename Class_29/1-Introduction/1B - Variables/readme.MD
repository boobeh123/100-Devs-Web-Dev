### Summary
The concepts covered in this chapter:
* Variables:
    * Stores reusable data in a program and labels it with a name. 
    * Stored in memory. 
    * Var keyword used pre-ES6. 
    * Let is preferred to declare a variable when it can be reassigned.
    * Const is preferred to declare a variable with a constant value.
    * Variables that have not been initialized store the primitive data type undefined.
* Mathematical assignment operators - Calculates a new value and assign it to the same variable.
* String concatenation:
    * The + operator is used to concatenate strings including string values held in variables.
    * In ES6, template literals use backticks ` and ${} to interpolate values into a string.
* Typeof operator - The typeof keyword returns the data type (as a string) of a value.


### Learn anything new?
Yes, it is baffling that topics and concepts I've covered, are still teaching me new things.

A couple things I didn't know:

Mathematical assignment operators:
The first time using /= was during this reading. 
I didn't know it existed, despite using += -= *=

Typeof keyword:
Checking the data type of a concatenated string + number. 
(it's still a string)

Variable:
Print the value of a variable BEFORE its defined.
variables declared with var return undefined, 
let & const result in a referenceError
