## Summary
The concepts covered in this chapter:

* A Function: A reusable block of code that groups together a sequence of statements to perform a specific task.
* Function declaration: One of the ways to create a function.
* A Parameter: Allow functions to accept input(s) & perform a task using the input(s).
* Calling a function: The code inside a function body executes only when the function is called.
* Default parameters: Allow parameters to have a predetermined value,
in case there is no argument passed into the function. This feature was added in ES6.
* Return keyword: To pass back information from the function call.
* Function expressions: Another way to create a function.
* Arrow function: A shorter way to write functions by using the special “fat arrow” () => notation. This feature was added in ES6.
* Concise body arrow function: Refactor arrow functions that contain one parameter and single-line code blocks.
