## Summary:

* If statements:          Checks a condition and will execute a task if that condition evaluates to true.
* If...else statements:   Make binary decisions (yes/no) and execute different code blocks based on a provided condition.
* Else if:                We can add more conditions using else if statements.
* Comparison operators:   Can compare two values.
* Logical operator (&&):  Checks if both provided expressions are truthy.
* Logical operator (||):  Checks if either provided expression is truthy.
* Bang operator    (!) :  Switches the truthiness and falsiness of a value.
* Ternary operator:       Shorthand to simplify concise if...else statements.
* Switch statement:       Can be used to simplify the process of writing multiple else if statements. 
* Break keyword:          Stops the remaining cases from being checked and executed in a switch statement.
