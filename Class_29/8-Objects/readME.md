## Summary:
The concepts covered in this chapter:

* Key-value pairs:
    * Objects store collections of key-value pairs.
    * Each key-value pair is a property—when a property is a function it is known as a method.
    * An object literal is composed of comma-separated key-value pairs surrounded by curly braces.
    * We can add methods to our object literals using key-value syntax with anonymous function expressions as values or by using the new ES6 method syntax.
* Accessing objects:
    * You can access, add or edit a property within an object by using dot notation or bracket notation.
    * We can navigate complex, nested objects by chaining operators.
    * Objects are mutable—we can change their properties even when they’re declared with const.
* Objects are passed by reference— when we make changes to an object passed into a function, those changes are permanent.
* We can iterate through objects using the For...in syntax.

## Learn anything new?:
Properties with spaces, special characters, or numbers have to be surrounded by quotes.
I've used dot notation for every interaction I've had with an object. I now know that bracket notation must be used to access a property if it contains spaces, specail characters, or numbers.
