## Summary
The concepts covered in this chapter:

* Scope: Refers to where variables can be accessed throughout the program, and is determined by where and how they are declared.
* Blocks: Statements that exist within curly braces {}.
* Global scope: Refers to the context within which variables are accessible to every part of the program.
* Global variables: Variables that exist within global scope.
* Block scope: Refers to the context within which variables are accessible only within the block they are defined.
* Local variables: Variables that exist within block scope.
* Global namespace: The space in our code that contains globally scoped information.
* Space pollution: When too many variables exist in a namespace or variable names are reused.
