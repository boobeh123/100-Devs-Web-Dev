## Summary:
The concepts covered in this chapter:
* Floats:
    * Places an element on the left or right side of its parent element, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. 
    * The element is removed from the normal flow of the page, though still remaining a part of the flow.
    * Clearing floats using the clear property.
    * Containing floats using a parent element as a container or the clearfix technique.
* Display: Inline-block:
    * Displays elements within a line and allows elements to accept all box model properties.
* The position property:
    * This property sets how an element is positioned in a document. 
        * Relative positioning:
            * Allows elements to appear within the normal flow a page.
            * Moves an element in relation to itself.
            * Doesn't allow other elements to flow around it.
        * Absolute positioning:
            * Removes an element from the normal flow of a page.
            * Moves an element to its closest relatively-positioned parent.
            * Overlaps surrounding elements

P.S. I have moved the project files into a separate folder.

## What did you learn?
I learned a couple ways to position elements on a page. I have created several layouts using floats and the project-practice uses inline-block to create a column layout. I have used the position property before and it's nice to have a better understanding of its capabilities. As always, my notes are in the main.js file and the new index.html contains examples from the reading.
