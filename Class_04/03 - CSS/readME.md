## Summary:
The concepts covered in this chapter:
* Cascade - CSS loads styles from top to bottom.
* Specificity weight:
    * Types selectors holds lowest weight of 1.
    * Class selectors holds medium weight of 10.
    * ID selectors holds most weight of 100.
* Color property:
    * Colors in CSS are defined on a sRGB color space. 
    * There are four ways to represent sRGB colors with CSS: 
        * Keywords
        * Hexadecimal notation
        * RGBa
        * HSLa
    * RGBa & HSLa have alpha/transparency channels to create semi-transparent or opaque colors.
* Length property:
    * Absolute lengths - Are fixed to a physical measurement.
    * Relative lengths - Rely on lengths of another measurement.
    * Pixels - The pixel is equal to 1/96th of an inch; There are 96 pixels in an inch.
    * Percentages - A relative value. Defined in relation to the length of another object. 
    * Em - A relative value. Its length is calculated based on an elementâ€™s font size.
