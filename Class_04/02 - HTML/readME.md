## Summary:
The concepts covered in this chapter:
* Semantics:
    * The practice of giving content on the page meaning and structure by using the proper element. 
    * Helps screen readers and search engines.
* < div > element:
    * Acts as containers and used for styling.
    * Block-level element.
* < span > element:
    * Acts as containers and used for styling.
    * Inline-level element.
* Block-level elements:
   * Block-level elements begin on a new line, stacking one on top of the other, and occupy any available width. 
   * Block-level elements may be nested and may wrap inline-level elements. 
* Inline-level elements:
   * Inline-level elements do not begin on a new line. 
   * They fall into the normal flow of a document, lining up one after the other, and only maintain the width of their content.
   * Inline-level elements may be nested and cannot wrap block-level elements. 
* Headings: 
    * Break up content and establish hierarchy
    * Block-level element.
    * Should not be used to style.
* Paragraphs:
    * Adds content to the page.
    * Block-level elements
* Adding importance to text using the < strong > element.
* Adding emphasis to text using the < em > element.
* Structural semantics:
    * < header >
        * Identifies the top of a page, article, or section.
        * May include a heading, paragraphs, nav.
    * < nav >
        * Identifies a section of major navigational links on a page. 
        * Reserved for pages within the same website 
    * < article >
        * Represents self-contained content
            * May be independently distributable or reusable.
    * < section >
        * Represents a generic standalone section of a document.
            * Should always have a heading.
    * < aside >
        * Represents a portion of a document to the document's main content.
        * Presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.

        * Represents the end of a section or article. 
        * Contains copyright data, links to related documents, or information about the author of the section.

I now know the differences and when to use a section or a div. 

It is important to have semantic code. Doing so will make a website more accessible to folks. 

I have a better understanding of when to use a header and a nav when creating a web page.
