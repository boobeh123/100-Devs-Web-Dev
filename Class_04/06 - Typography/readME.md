## Summary:
The concepts covered in this chapter:
* Typeface - A typeface is what we see. It is the impression of how text looks and reads.
* Font - A font is a file that contains a typeface. Using a font allows the computer to access the typeface.
    * Web-safe fonts - Fonts that are available to every web-browsing-capable device.
    * @font-face rule - Specifies a custom font with which to display text. Loaded from computer or server.
* Font-based properties - Properties that edit the look of text on a page.
    * font-family: Used to declare which font(s) should be used to display text.
    * font-size: Sets the size of the font.
    * font-style: Sets whether a font should be styled with a normal, italic, or oblique face from its font-family.
    * font-variant: Allows you to set all the font variants for a font.
    * font-weight: Sets the boldness of the font. 
    * All these properties can be combined into one font property and shorthand value. 
* Text-based properties - Properties that edit the look of text on a page.
    * text-align: Sets the horizontal alignment of the content inside a block element.
    * text-decoration: Sets the appearance of decorative lines on text. 
    * text-indent: Sets the length of indentation that is put before lines of text in a block.
    * text-shadow: Allows us to add a shadow or multiple shadows to text. 
    * box-shadow: Adds shadow effects around an element's frame.
    * text-transform: Specifies how to capitalize an element's text. 
* Line-height: Sets the height of a line box. 
    * The best practice for legibility:
        * Set line-height to 1.5x the font-size property value.
    * Can be used to vertically center a single line of text within an element 
* Letter-spacing: Sets the horizontal space between the letters. 
    * Using a relative length value ensures that we maintain the correct spacing between letters. 
* Word-spacing: Sets the length of space between words and between tags.
* Quotations & Citations:
    * cite element - Used to reference to an author or creative work. 
    * q element - Indicates that the enclosed text is a short inline quotation. 
    * blockquote element - Indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. 

## What did you learn?
Project: I learned that fonts and text color truly have an impact when creating a website. Take a peek at the project layout and see what typography can do.

Reading: I didn't know about the font-face at rule. I was not aware there is a best practice for legibility when using the line-height property. I used the cite, inline quote elements to reference a book and a short quote. I am not sure if I used the blockquote element when referencing a Fortune article.
