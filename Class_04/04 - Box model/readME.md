## Summary:
The concepts covered in this chapter:
* The Box Model:
    * Every element on a page is a rectangular box. 
    * The box model is additive by default. 
    * The total width & height of a box can be calculated
    * CSS3 introduced the box-sizing property sets how the total width and height of an element is calculated.
        * Border-box - This value alters the box model, including border and padding values within the width & height of an element.
        * Content-box - This value is the default, allowing the box model to have an additive design. 
* Display property - Sets whether an element is treated as a block or inline element.
    * Inline-block value - Generates a block element box that 
    falls into the flow of surrounding content, lining up one after the other.
    * A none value hides an element and renders the page as if that element doesnâ€™t exist. Any elements nested within this element will also be hidden.
* Margin property - Allows us to set the amount of space that surrounds an element. 
    * Margins fall outside of any border and can be used to help position elements.
    * Vertical margins are accepted by block & inline-block elements. Not accepted by inline-level elements.
* Padding property - The padding property allows us to provide spacing directly within an element.
* Border property - Provide an outline around an element and fall between the padding and margin.
    * Can be placed on a single side of an element.
* Border-radius property - Enables us to round the corners of an element's border.
* Developer Tools:
    * These tools allow us to inspect an elements on a page.
    * They allow us to see where that element lives within the HTML document.
    * They allow us to see which CSS properties and values are being applied to it.

## Learn anything new?
I am aware of most concepts covered in this chapter. I am glad that CSS3 introduced the border-box value for the box-sizing property.
