## Summary:
The concepts covered in this chapter:
* Backgrounds - Helps with assigning priorities, establish groupings, and have an influence on a website’s usability.
* Background-based properties:
    * background-property - Accepts colors and images.
    * background-color - Used for setting solid background colors.
    * background-image - Sets one or more background images on an element.
    * background-repeat - Sets how background images are repeated. 
    * background-position - Sets the initial position for each background image. 
        * The position is relative.
    * All of these properties can be combined into a shorthand value.
    * background-size - Sets the size of the element's background image.
        * cover value - Specifies that the background-image will be resized to completely cover an element’s width and height.
        * contain value - Specifies that the background-image will be resized to reside entirely contained within an element’s width and height.
    * background-clip - Allows a background image to extend into the same area as any border. Set as border-box by default. 
    * background-origin - Allows the beginning of a background image to extend into the padding of an element. Set as padding-box by default.
* Gradient backgrounds - Treated as background images. 
    * linear-gradient() - Creates an image of a transition between two or more colors along a straight line.
        * The gradient can move.
    * radial-gradient() - Creates an image of a transition between two or more colors that radiate from an origin.
        * Its shape may be a circle or an ellipse 
    * Declare a separate background-color as a fallback when browsers do not support gradient.
* Multiple background images - CSS3 introdced the use of more than one background image on an element.

## What did you learn?
Reading: This chapter taught me that multiple background-images can be used and that gradients CAN MOVE! This reading covers background deeply. 

Project: Visually when you look at it, a lot has changed and it looks better! Under the hood, most changes were changing values to already-existing properties.
