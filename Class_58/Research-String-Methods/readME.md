## Lessons learned:
I have used most of these methods when solving code challenges from CodeWars. 

I have a decent understanding of how each method can solve a problem.

I need to read about Data Structures & Algorithms so I can better understand how these methods work underneath the hood & which methods are more performant than other methods. I currently don't know how to answer the "time complexity" portion and I will come back to this readME when I am able to answer.

## Source:
Give a short description of:
* What the method does
* How it works
* It's time complexity 
* Give three examples of it in action
