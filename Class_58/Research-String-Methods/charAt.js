/*

Description:
The charAt() method returns a new string consisting of the single UTF-16 code unit 
located at the specified offset into the string.

How it works:
Calling this method on a string returns a new string with the specific character or letter 
located at the index that was passed in as a parameter.


Time complexity:
Will comeback to answer this after reading about algorithms:

// Examples:
const str = 'Hello world'

// Retrieving the character or letter at index 0
console.log(str.charAt(0))  // Output -> "H"

// Retrieving the character or letter at index 5
console.log(str.charAt(5))  // Output -> " "

// Retrieving the character or letter at index 6
console.log(str.charAt(6))  // Output -> "w"
