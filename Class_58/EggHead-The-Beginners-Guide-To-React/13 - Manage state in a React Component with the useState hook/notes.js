/*

htmlFor is the JSX version of the for attribute in HTML.

To use state in a React function component, 
you use the useState hook from React. 

The useState hook accepts the initial value, when a component is initially rendered, 
that is going to be the value.
Any time we call this second element of the array, 
our updater function will trigger a re-render of this entire function component. 
When React useState is called again, 
it will ignore the initial value and instead give us the current value.
