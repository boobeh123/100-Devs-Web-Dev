* Create a User Interface with React’s JSX syntax

/*

* The past couple lessons we created elements. It is not the way the community creates React elements. 
* Most of the community is using JSX, which is an HTML-like syntax in our JavaScript.

* The browser does not understand JSX natively. 
    * JSX syntax needs to be compiled with Babel so the browser can understand.

* Babel is a JavaScript compiler that supports non-standard features &  the next generation of JavaScript.
    * Babel will compile scripts with a type of "text/babel"
    * In a typical application, we will have a tool to compile JSX for us.
        * For the purpose of this lesson we will use Babel to compile JSX.
    * We would NOT want to use the in-browser Babel transformer in production code.
