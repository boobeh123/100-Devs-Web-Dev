## Summary:
The concepts covered in this video:

* What is react?
    * A javascript library for building user interfaces
    * Created and maintained by facebook 
* Single Page Application (SPA)
    * A single html page with routing done through React
        * Routing requires a package called react router dom
* You can't directly communicate with your database
    * React will send requests to the server and the server would serve JSON data
* React has an entire ecosystem of packages that make it function as a full-fledged framework 
* React gives you a way to structure the view layer of your application 
* React allows you to build your UI using reusable components
* JSX allows us to write dynamic HTML and we don't have to separate our markup from our logic 
* React & virtual DOM - Allows parts of the page that need to be updated without reloading 
* React increases speed, performance, interactiveness & allows for testing benefits.
* One-way data binding helps data to be managed easily. 
* State is an object that determines how a component renders and behave
* Use JSON server as a mock back-end to see how React functions when building a full-stack application.

## Lessons learned:
Going through this crash course gave me a deeper understanding of the definitions behind some syntax and concepts.

The thing I did not think about at all before & after building the project was: "How & where do I deploy a create-react-app?"
I was able to build the project & deployed a static version to netlify.

My next question was: 
"How & where do I deploy a create-react-app with a JSON server?" 
"How & where do I deploy a create-react-app with a backend?

These questions is definitely my next step in growing with React. I know I will gain more confidence with this framework with time & building.

Note that: This crash course was created in 2021 before the React-Router updated to v6 and you will run into bugs when implementing routing.

P.S: (STATIC VERSION ONLY NO BACKEND) Project deployed here: https://silver-maamoul-ddab91.netlify.app/
