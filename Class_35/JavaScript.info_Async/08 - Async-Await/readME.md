## Summary:
The concepts covered in this reading:

* The async keyword:
    * Placed before a function.
        * Allows the function to always return a promise.
        * Allows the await keyword to be used in the async function.
* The await keyword:
    * Allows JavaScript to wait until that promise settles.
        * It will return a result or an error.

## Lessons learned:
This chapter offers multiple opportunities to refactor code using async/await. I learned more from doing these examples & tasks than the reading was able to offer. 

After going over every chapter in the Async reading, using async/await is definitely much easier to use and understand than callbacks and promises.

I am excited to start learning Node.js and apply what I've learned.
