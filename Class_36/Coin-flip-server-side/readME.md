## Lessons learned:
Building coin flip application is a task that I have tackled multiple times.
This iteration where randomization happens on the server-side is the most advanced form that I have built.
The build itself didn't teach me much, but deploying to Heroku has given me the repetition to familiarize myself with the process to deploy projects where a backend is involved.
