## Summary:
The concepts covered in this video:

* Terminology:
    * Express - A framework for building web applications on top of Node.js
        * Simplifies the server creation process
        * Node allows JavaScript as the server-side language.
    * MongoDB - A database where information is stored for websites or applications.
        * This information can be retrieved and displayed on applications.
    * CRUD - A set of operations we get servers to execute.
        * Allows Rest APIs to be constructed.
* Read:
    * Browsers perform the READ operation when visiting a website.
        * Browsers send a GET request to the server to perform READ operations.
* Create:
    * Browsers perform a CREATE operation if they send a POST request to the server.
        * POST requests are triggered through JavaScript or `<form>` elements.
* Body-parser middleware:
    * Helps tidy up the request object.
    * Can be used to extract data from the `<form>` element & add them to the body property in the request object.
