This folder contains two files, one for each assignment.

The file named "thecocktaildb-spaces.js" CONTAINS ONLY the javascript solution:
"Make the cocktailDB api work with spaces between the names!"

The file named "thecocktaildb-carousel.js" will be a fully functional web application with a index.html and style.css.
This iteration will also contain the "spaces" solution.
