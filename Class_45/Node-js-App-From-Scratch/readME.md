## Lessons learned:
A lot of new technologies were presented to me while building this project. 
The notable ones are:
* Mongoose: I would like to understand more about Schema models. 
* Passport: It's so cool to be able to have registered users & account creation. I would like to see how similar local account creation is.
* Materialize: This one blew my mind. It has potential to save a lot of time by being able to use the built-in classes/components to style a website.
* Handlebars: This confused me the most, but seemed simpler than EJS. I am certain that with more time & use, my observation may be valid.
